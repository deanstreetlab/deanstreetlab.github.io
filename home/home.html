            <h1>Drunken Walk</h1>
            <p>Life is a random walk highly sensitive to initial condition, in which my realised path has largely been sub-optimal. I attended the wrong school, studied the wrong subject, graduated at the wrong time, worked for the wrong companies in the wrong industry. To right the wrong, I decided to deprecate life 1.0 and fork into life 2.0. </p>
            <p>In life 1.0, years were spent reading economics and business subjects, which I find soft, unintellectual, and worthless (ie bullshit). Thenceforth, a career in the old-fashioned relationship-based finance industry only reinforced my perception that the society is full of shit. To downsize the bullshit, a major reset was in order.</p>
            <p>Technology and science are at the centre of life 2.0. Time is spent thinking about ideas and working on things. I am transitioning towards a quant analyst, data scientist, and full-stack programmer.</p>
            <p>My intellectual interests include statistical inference, time series analysis, stochastic processes, causality, and genetic algorithms. </p>

            <h1>Old, Verbose, Unfunctional</h1>
            <p>As a traditional finance guy without any formal programming training and experience, I self-learn programming from books and VS Code. </p>
            <p>I've adopted <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/">Java</a> as the core language. Despite complaints about Java's legacy baggage and verbosity, I find it an excellent first langauge because it is formal, structured, and strong/statically-typed, as well as more than well-documented. </p>
            <p>My data analysis and computing stack includes <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a>, <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, and <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>. Database knowledge is mainly relational (<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>, <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>) with a bit of non-relational (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/2">Mongo</a>, <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>, <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">Influx</a>). </p>

            <h1>Technology is Democracy</h1>
            <p>Fairness and democracy are theoretical ideals in this structurally rigged world. Others have more money, more power, more connections. We are underdogs. We work much harder for much less. They do business on relationship. My data are already relational. They call their connections for favours. My codes call APIs for data. They like networking and handshaking with who's who. My programs are constantly networking and handshaking with MySQL.</p> 
            <p>All I have are a pair of working hands, a functioning brain, and a von Neumann machine. Imagination is innate. Knowledge is unbiased. Technology is empowerment. Data simulate experience. These are my sole weapons to levelling the playing field. </p>

          <div id="" class="contents">
            <h1>Less is More</h1>
            <p>Materialism and consumption-driven model have substantially enhanced living standards and expanded that hypothetical productivity frontier. More options are often better indeed, if <i>other things</i> are equal, which are not. Excessive optionality has become noise, drowning out the signals. Intrinsically meaningless status-quo becomes the unquestioned way of life or goal in life. People's values are altered in exchange for materials. Instead of having more, doing more with less is what we should aim for. </p>
            <p>We are born naked and leave naked. That's rare fairness at endpoints. In between, I think one should strive to uphold his beliefs and values as well as single-mindedly pursuing his signals. As mere mortals, subjective life meanings are objectively meaningless and the objective function should be to minimise regrets rather than to maximise variables. That way, at least one can have something to self-illude rather than manipulated by outside forces. As <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus">Albert Camus</a></i> said, life is essentially absurd and one should rebel the meaninglessness by living and thinking freely.</p>
