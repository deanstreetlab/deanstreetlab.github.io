<div id="problem">
Inside a box of $15$ balls, $9$ are new.
<br>
$3$ balls are picked randomly and used, then returned to the box.
<br>
Later, another $3$ balls are again picked randomly from the box. 
<br>
What's the probability that all $3$ balls are new?


</div>

<div id="solution">
There are two random picks of $3$ balls each. Let $A_i$ denote that first pick where $i$ is the number of used balls picked, so $A_2$ denotes $2$ out of the $3$ balls picked are used.
<br>
Let $B$ be the event that all $3$ balls are new in the second pick.
The desired probability is then,
\begin{align}
  P(B) &= P(B | A_0)P(A_0) + P(B | A_1)P(A_1) + P(B | A_2)P(A_2) + P(B | A_3)P(A_3) \\
  &= \sum_{i=0}^3 \frac{ { {9-3+i} \choose 3} }{ {15 \choose 3} } \cdot \frac{ {6 \choose i} {9 \choose {3-i}} }{ {15 \choose 3} }   \\
  &\approx 0.09
\end{align}
