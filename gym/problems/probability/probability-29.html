<div id="problem">

 Five people, say A, B, C, D, E, are randomly arranged in linear order.
 <br>
 What's the probability that
 <ol>
 <li>there is one person between A and B.</li>
 <li>there are two persons between A and B.</li>
 <li>there are three persons between A and B.</li>
 </ol>

</div>

<div id="solution">

  a. 
  First, just consider the case where A presedes B. A few example arrangements are
  $$
  \{A, C, B, E, D \} \quad \{C, E, A, D, B \} \quad \{D, A, C, B, E \}
  $$
  
  The point is to treat $\{A X B \}$ as one element where $X$ is a wildcard. Then
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item there are $3!$ arrangements for the $3$ elements
    \item there are $3$ possible arrangements for the wildcard
    \item A and B can swap positions for $\{A X B \}$ or $\{B X A \}$
  \end{itemize}

  Hence,
  $$
  \left( \frac{3! \cdot 3 \cdot 2}{5!} \right) = 0.3
  $$  

  b.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item there are $2!$ arrangements for the $2$ elements
    \item there are $3 \cdot 2$ possible arrangements for the wildcards
    \item A and B can swap positions for $\{A X X B \}$ or $\{B X X A \}$
  \end{itemize}

  Hence,
  $$
  \left( \frac{2! \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2}{5!} \right) = 0.2
  $$  
  
  c.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item there is $1!$ arrangement for the $1$ element
    \item there are $3!$ possible arrangements for the wildcards 
    \item A and B can swap positions for $\{A X X X B \}$ or $\{B X X X A \}$
  \end{itemize}

  Hence,
  $$
  \left( \frac{1! \cdot 3! \cdot 2}{5!} \right) = 0.1
  $$
