<div id="problem">

 A statistics teacher handed out a set of 10 problems to take home. 5 of them will appear exactly the same in a test. 
 <br>
 Tiger has figured out 7 of them but not the others.
 <br>
 What's the probability that Tiger will correctly answer
 <ol>
  <li>all 5 problems?</li>
  <li>at least 4 of the problems?</li>
 </ol>

</div>

<div id="solution">

  a. 
  $$
    \left( \frac{ {7\choose 5} }{ { 10\choose 5} } \right) \approx 0.08
  $$

  b.
  $$
    \left( \frac{ {7\choose 4}{3\choose 1} }{10 \choose 5} \right) + 0.08 \approx 0.5
  $$
