<div id="problem">
  What's the probability of one being dealt a full house out of an ordinary deck of cards?
  <br><br>
  <small>
  Note: A full house is a hand consisting of 3 of the same value and a pair.

<div id="solution">

  Firstly, the $ {52 \choose 5} $ possible hands are equally likely.
  <br><br>
  There are $ {4 \choose 3} {4 \choose 2} $ arrangements of say 3 kings and 2 sevens.
  <br>
  Because there are $13$ choices for the 3-card values and then $12$ for the pair, it follows that the desired probability is
  $$
    \frac{13 \cdot 12 \cdot {4\choose 3} \cdot {4\choose 2}}{52\choose 5} \approxi 0.0014
  $$
